# Dunix

## Dunix is a Tool & Services-Oriented Operation based on the Durango Xbox Codename.

# Tools

Tools, such as [XBL-Follower-Bot](https://github.com/DunixOS/XBL-Follower-Bot) require tokens, you can get tokens using the [Xbox Live Account Creation Tool](https://github.com/DunixOS/XBL-Account-Creator), which (when completed) will allow you to create multiple (over 1000 if you want) tokens which can then be used for whatever you see fit.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to these tools, it is recommended that you at least have some experience with the Xbox Live API, and have made or used tools in the past, doing so would make this alot easier, if you would like to contribute, you can DM [@playfairs](<https://discord.com/users/1426711359059394662>) on Discord.

If you do in fact DM me on Discord, please don't ask me to make something that isn't already here, such as things like an Autoclaimer, I will get around to that stuff when I can, I get DMs all the time of people asking me to make one. And it's annoying.
